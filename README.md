# Chillflix

Welcome to Chillflix !

Chillflix is a group project made during my formation at the Wild Code School.  
This project coonsisted in the making of a movie recommendation algorithm from the IMDB database.

The Colab Notebook contains the KNN algorithm used to predict a list of 10 movies from a movie inputed by the user.

CSV FILES :
------

**EncCRYN_R.csv** : Contains the encoded ratings, number of votes, movie crew, year.  
**KMeans_G_15.csv** : Contains the movie genres clustered with a K-Means algorithm.  
**table_name.csv** : Contains year information about movies.
